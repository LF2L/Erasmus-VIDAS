Enterprises and educational institutions are quickly shifting towards the digital sphere. This digital transformation implies that not only we need to adapt to the available technologies currently in the market, but also, it is highly imperative to take into account the structures, dynamics and competencies needed to support this in the long term. The education of our future generations is one of the most key aspects of civilization. Thus, It is needed to empower the main actors of this education sphere (teachers and student) in terms of developing strategies and methodologies fostering the innovation skills of the new generations.\nThe academic sphere has traditionally been a very personal activity, which now faces incredible challenges to its successful achievement. There are already international project that are been developed, and we cannot afford to give a step backwards. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to co-create a VIrtual and Distributed Academic Sandbox (VIDAS), in order to test and validate a set of digital tools to guide educators and students in this digital transition, doing a main focus on the development innovation and technology management teaching Our vision is of integrated, modern, digital teaching in innovation management that are supported by a thriving digital tools to implement in the early stages of innovation phases for engineering students. This includes the conformation of the group, creativity sessions, working in a sustainable partnership of three european universities.\nThe European Commission, and more specifically the Erasmus+ Program, have responded to this difficulty by taking up the challenge to confirm its role as the main EU instrument supporting innovation in education. The new vision of this program is for the modernisation and digitalisation of education and training systems across Europe.\nThe goal is to reinforce the ability of education and training institutions to provide high quality, inclusive digital education. The focus will be on building capacity to implement online blended and distance teaching and learning; to develop digital pedagogical competences of educators, enabling them to deliver high quality inclusive digital education; and to develop and/or use high quality digital content such as innovative online resources and tools. The partnerships will promote networking of institutions across the EU, sharing of resources and expertise, and collaboration with digital technology providers and experts in education and pedagogical practice to develop tailor made solutions adapted to local challenges and realities.\nTherefore, the project VIDAS will be particularly target toward the innovation and team management competences under the development of the innovation project between the universities Univ Lorraine, TU Kaiserslautern and Delft. These three Universities already have a history of partnerships, ranging from student semesters abroad to collaboration on projects. To further bolster these relationships within the current context, the Erasmus+ Program would not only be beneficial but also provide a different paradigm for these institutions to progress in their objective of educating future generations.\nMoreover, EFFENCY is a multicultural start-up that specialises in maximising collective intelligence. Over the past four years they have developed blended learning tools such as a digital coach which is easily and directly plugged-in to different collaborative platforms (e.g. Microsoft Teams). The construction of these tools is based on a cognitive science research that empower individuals to accelerate quality relationships within professional and academic contexts. EFFENCY accompanies team members on a regular basis to improve their soft skills and to work better together. The solution evaluates the collaborative profile of a team based on 8 character traits. This diagnostic then enables the team to take advantage of customized digital coaching, according to each member’s profile in the team. The coaching program developed by professional coaches consists of theoretical concepts, practical exercises, personal and team challenges, tips and advice all of which will help them find their place within the team and to create cohesion in a more enjoyable atmosphere. The tools developed and implemented by EFFENCY will underscore the already existing network between these universities, catalyse their digital transition and facilitate interactions between students all over Europe.\nGoals\nTherefore, the main expected goals of this project includes\nThe development of a educational toolkit for innovation project management in distributed teams\nTeams creation\nCreativity application\nProject management tools / methodologies\n\nOpen-source Platform? (MooC, or/and Apps)? To support MoT in innovation process\nTraining documentation\nDissemination via scientific documentation of the experiences of pilot project with DELFT and TUK\nThe consortium\nThis project is a step forward of an on-going process of cooperation between the partners started several years ago.\nFrom our side it could be mentioned:\nUL-TUK: Since 2000, the Engineering school (ENSGSI) of the Université de Lorraine and the\nTechnische Universität Kaiserslautern have a common engineering degree. More than 90 alumni from both universities, has been beneficiated of this program which is awarded since its beginning bythe UFA binational program (French-German Universities Network). Together, a common workshop on industry 4.0 to be held on 2020 has obtained the sponsoring of the UFA program.\nUL-TU DELFT: Since more than 10 years the both universities are part of the IAMOT – ICE communities (Innovation and technology management). Since 2017 a joint semester at the master’s degree level has been implemented within the framework of the Erasmus program. A co-supervised PhD has been accomplished in 2018. To finish in 2019, Dr Ortt has been invited professor at the ENSGSI school for 1-month period. A number of joint scientific papers has been already published.\nclass: middle, center\nThanks\n\n\n",
